Groundwater contamination due to heavy metals poses a serious threat to human health and the environment. Monitoring and assessing the levels of metals such as lead, cadmium, chromium, copper, zinc, iron, manganese, and nickel is critical to ensure safe drinking water and sustainable water resources management. Manual analysis of groundwater samples can be time-consuming and prone to error.

AquaSure aims to streamline the process of groundwater quality assessment by calculating pollution indices based on metal concentrations, comparing them against standard limits, and providing a comprehensive overview of water safety. The tool helps researchers, environmentalists, and local authorities efficiently analyze groundwater data, make informed decisions, and take timely actions to protect public health.
